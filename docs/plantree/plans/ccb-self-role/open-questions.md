# CCB Self Role Open Questions

Date: 2026-06-09

## Product

1. Should `ccb_self` be included in a default template, or remain an optional
   role users add to projects that need runtime maintenance?
2. Should the default provider be Codex only for the first slice, or should the
   role declare Claude/OpenCode-compatible variants at launch?
3. Should `ccb ask agentroles.ccb_self ...` resolve as a role alias when the
   role is bound once, or should user docs always target `ccb_self` directly?

## Permission Model

1. Should the role ever use `ccb kill`, or should project-wide shutdown remain
   user-only?

## Implementation

1. Should the first diagnostic helper be a `ccb_self` built-in script, an MCP
   server, or both, given that the role package can include scripts before MCP
   is stable?
2. What exact JSON schema should `ccb_runtime_snapshot` return so it remains
   useful across future daemon graph versions?
3. Where should read-only tmux namespace evidence be sourced from when WSL
   mounted-drive compatibility redirects sockets and runtime files?
4. Should screenshot capture be opt-in per request, or enabled by default for
   `ccb_self` diagnostics but limited to CCB-owned panes/windows?
5. Should visual analysis rely on provider-native image understanding, or
   should the MCP tool also provide OCR/text extraction for providers without
   image input?
